# AI-Powered Internal Developer Platform: Augmenting Existing IDP Investments

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a vision for enhancing Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) with agentic AI capabilities while preserving and extending existing infrastructure investments. Our approach addresses the growing demand for natural language interfaces in development workflows while solving critical challenges around reproducibility, governance, and integration with established infrastructure-as-code (IaC) practices.

## 2. Problem Statement

Today's developers increasingly leverage AI to generate code, yet still require robust platforms to host that code and manage underlying infrastructure. While natural language interfaces offer convenience, they introduce significant challenges:

- **Inconsistency**: AI systems may generate different outputs for similar prompts
- **Lack of Auditability**: Conversations and decisions can be lost or forgotten
- **Governance Gaps**: Unconstrained AI might create resources that violate organizational policies
- **Integration Complexity**: Bridging natural language requests with existing IaC toolchains

Traditional GUI-based infrastructure provisioning suffers from similar issues - it relies on human memory and lacks the codification, version control, and reproducibility that made IaC the standard for infrastructure management.

## 3. Proposed Solution Overview

We propose an AI-powered enhancement to existing IDPs that translates natural language requests into governed, version-controlled infrastructure definitions. Rather than replacing established systems, our approach augments them by adding a natural language interface that generates standardized, policy-compliant infrastructure code.

### Core Principles

1. **Intent-to-State Translation**: Convert natural language into structured desired state representations
2. **Early Governance Integration**: Embed governance policies at the earliest interaction points to provide immediate feedback and guide developers toward compliant solutions from the start.
3. **IaC Foundation**: Generate and maintain infrastructure as code that integrates with existing toolchains
4. **Template-Driven Consistency**: Leverage standardized patterns for common application architectures
5. **Full Auditability**: Maintain traceability from natural language request to deployed infrastructure
6. **Augmentation, Not Replacement**: Extend existing IDP investments rather than replacing them

## 4. Key Architectural Components

### 4.1 [Natural Language Interface](4.1.natural-language.md)

A conversational interface that allows developers to express infrastructure needs in natural language. This interface captures the developer's intent and context, providing a more accessible entry point than traditional GUIs or raw IaC.

Incorporates governance-aware prompting to prevent non-compliant requests.

### 4.2 [Intent Recognition & Parameter Extraction](4.2.intent-recognition.md)

This component analyzes natural language requests to:
- Identify the type of infrastructure or service being requested
- Leverages governance policies to guide conversations and validate parameters in real-time.
- Extract key parameters (names, sizes, configurations)
- Classify the request into known patterns (API servers, Kafka consumers, etc.)

### 4.3 [MCP-Based Tool Constrained System](4.3.mcp-tools.md)

Leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we define a set of tools that the AI agent can use to interact with the infrastructure. These tools enforce governance and consistency by:

- Exposing only approved resource types and configurations
- Providing clear parameters and validation
- Ensuring deterministic outputs for given inputs

Example MCP tools:
- `create_api_server(params)`
- `create_kafka_consumer(params)`
- `create_database(params)`
- `validate_configuration(params)`

### 4.4 [Template & Pattern Library](4.4.templates-patterns.md)

A curated collection of templates for common application patterns:
- **Code Templates**: Standardized starting points for different application types
- **Infrastructure Templates**: Pre-defined Terraform/CloudFormation modules
- **Configuration Schemas**: Structured definitions of customizable parameters

For example, an "API Server" pattern might include:
- Application code template (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- Associated infrastructure (compute, networking, security groups)
- Default database (PostgreSQL)
- Default caching layer (Redis)

### 4.5 [Desired State Representation](4.5.desired-state.md)

A standardized, structured representation (JSON/YAML) that captures:
- The developer's intent
- Extracted parameters
- Selected templates and patterns
- Governance decisions

This representation becomes the "source of truth" that is version-controlled and linked to the original conversation.

### 4.6 [Governance & Policy Engine](4.6.governance.md)

Enforces organizational policies by:
- Validating requested resources against approved configurations
- Applying cost, security, and compliance constraints
- Auto-correcting or flagging violations
- Providing feedback to developers

### 4.7 [IaC Generation Layer](4.7.iac-generation.md)

Converts the governed desired state into executable infrastructure code:
- Generates Terraform, CloudFormation, or other IaC formats
- Uses versioned templates and modules
- Maintains consistency through standardized patterns
- Integrates with existing CI/CD pipelines

### 4.8 [Audit & Traceability System](4.8.audit.md)

Maintains a complete record of:
- Original natural language requests
- Generated desired state representations
- Governance decisions and policy applications
- Resulting infrastructure code
- Deployment status and outcomes

## 5. Integration with Wider IDP Ecosystem

Our AI-powered enhancement is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing IDP investments, extending their capabilities rather than replacing them. This approach preserves the value of current systems while adding new functionality.

### 5.1 Augmenting Existing IDP Components

The AI-powered components serve as an additional interface layer that enhances existing IDP functionality:

- **Source Control Management**: We continue to leverage existing SCM systems to store generated IaC code and desired state representations, maintaining established version control practices.
  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Generated infrastructure code feeds into existing CI/CD pipelines, preserving established deployment processes, approval gates, and environment management.
  
- **Service Catalog**: Our template library extends existing service catalogs by providing AI-generated templates that adhere to the same governance standards as manually created entries.
  
- **Security & Compliance**: The governance engine integrates with existing security and compliance frameworks, extending their reach to AI-generated infrastructure without creating new silos.
  
- **Cost Management**: AI-generated resources are tracked through existing cost management systems, maintaining unified financial oversight.

# Intent Recognition & Parameter Extraction: Detailed Specification

## 1. Introduction

The Intent Recognition & Parameter Extraction component serves as the critical first step in our AI-powered IDP architecture. This component is responsible for transforming natural language requests from developers into structured data that the rest of the system can process. It bridges the gap between human expression and machine-understandable commands, ensuring that the system can reliably interpret and act upon developer requests.

## 2. Component Overview

This component performs three primary functions:

1. **Intent Recognition**: Identifying the type of infrastructure or service being requested
2. **Parameter Extraction**: Extracting specific values, configurations, and requirements from the natural language input
3. **Governance-Aware Guidance**: Leveraging organizational policies to guide conversations and validate parameters in real-time

Together, these functions convert unstructured developer requests into a structured intermediate representation that feeds into the MCP-based tool system.

## 3. Intent Recognition

### 3.1 Purpose

Intent recognition determines what the developer wants to create or modify. It classifies the request into known patterns that the system supports, such as "API server," "Kafka consumer," "database," etc.

### 3.2 Approach

We use a combination of techniques to ensure accurate intent recognition:

1. **LLM-based Classification**: A fine-tuned language model analyzes the conversation context and request to determine the most likely intent. 
 
2. **Pattern Matching**: For common, well-defined requests, we use pattern matching to quickly identify intents with high confidence.

3. **Contextual Analysis**: The system considers the conversation history to disambiguate requests that might have multiple interpretations.

4. **Confidence Scoring**: Each intent classification includes a confidence score, with low-confidence results triggering clarification questions.

### 3.3 Supported Intents

The system recognizes a predefined set of intents that map to available infrastructure patterns:

- `create_api_server`: Create a new API server
- `create_kafka_consumer`: Create a Kafka consumer application
- `create_kafka_producer`: Create a Kafka producer application
- `create_database`: Create a new database
- `create_cache`: Create a caching layer
- `create_storage`: Create storage resources
- `update_configuration`: Modify existing infrastructure
- `delete_resource`: Remove existing infrastructure

### 3.4 Implementation Details

The intent recognition process follows these steps:

1. **Conversation Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the input text, removing irrelevant elements.

2. **Context Enrichment**: Add relevant context from the conversation history and user profile.

3. **Intent Classification**: Pass the enriched text to the classification model.

4. **Confidence Assessment**: Evaluate the model's confidence in its classification.

5. **Clarification (if needed)**: If confidence is below a threshold, ask clarifying questions.

6. **Intent Determination**: Finalize the intent based on classification and any clarifications.

### 3.5 Governance Integration

The intent recognition component incorporates governance policies at multiple points:

1. **Policy-Aware Prompting**: System prompts include relevant governance policies that guide the LLM's responses
2. **Real-time Validation**: Extracted parameters are validated against governance rules during the conversation
3. **Guided Refinement**: When potential policy violations are detected, the system guides users toward compliant alternatives
4. **Contextual Policy Retrieval**: Policies are dynamically retrieved based on user identity, team, and target environment

## 4. Parameter Extraction

### 4.1 Purpose

Parameter extraction identifies specific values, configurations, and requirements within the natural language request. While intent recognition tells us *what* the developer wants to create, parameter extraction tells us *how* they want it configured.

### 4.2 Approach

Parameter extraction uses a structured approach to identify and validate parameters:

1. **Schema-Guided Extraction**: Each intent has an associated parameter schema that defines what parameters can be extracted and their expected types.

6. **Entity Recognition**: The system identifies entities (names, numbers, technical terms) within the text.

7. **Relationship Mapping(*: The system maps extracted entities to specific parameters in the schema.

8. **Inference and Defaults**: For parameters not explicitly mentioned, the system infers values from context or applies sensible defaults.

9. **Validation**: Extracted parameters are validated against the schema and governance rules.

### 4.3 Parameter Types

The system handles various parameter types:

- **String Parameters**: Names, descriptions, identifiers
- **Numeric Parameters**: Sizes, quantities, limits
- **Boolean Parameters**: Flags, toggles
- **Enum Parameters**: Selections from predefined options
- **Complex Parameters**: Nested structures with multiple properties

### 4.4 Implementation Details

The parameter extraction process follows these steps:

1. **Schema Selection**: Based on the recognized intent, select the appropriate parameter schema.

2. **Entity Extraction**: Identify potential parameter values within the text.

3. **Entity Classification**: Classify each extracted entity according to the schema.

4. **Value Normalization**: Convert extracted values to the appropriate data types.

5. **Inference and Defaults**: Apply default values for missing parameters based on context and organizational standards.

6. **Validation**: Verify that all required parameters are present and that values are within acceptable ranges.

7. **Parameter Set Construction**: Assemble the final parameter set for processing.

## 5. Examples

allow {
  input.resource.type == "database"
  input.estimated_cost <= 1000
}

# Generate violation messages
violation[msg] {
  not allow
  msg := sprintf("Database cost %v exceeds limit of 1000", [input.estimated_cost])
