# Natural Language Interface: Detailed Specification

## 1. Introduction

The Natural Language Interface (NLI) is the user-facing component of our AI-powered Internal Developer Platform. It serves as the primary interaction point between developers and the system, allowing users to express their infrastructure needs in conversational natural language. This component is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and context-aware, providing a seamless experience that abstracts away the complexity of underlying infrastructure management.

## 2. Component Overview

The NLI is responsible for:

1. **User Interaction**: Providing a conversational interface for developers to express their infrastructure needs
2. **Context Management**: Maintaining conversation history and user context across multiple interactions
3. **Input Validation**: Ensuring user input is clean and appropriate for processing
4. **Output Presentation**: Displaying system responses in a clear, organized manner
5. **Error Handling**: Providing helpful feedback when system cannot understand or execute requests
6. **Progress Indication**: Showing status of long-running operations and tasks

## 3. Design Principles

### 3.1 Conversational Experience

The NLI adopts a chat-like interface that feels natural and intuitive to developers:

- **Multi-modal Communication**: Supports text, voice, and potential inputs where appropriate
- **Contextual Memory**: Remembers previous interactions within a session and across sessions
- **Prompt Templating**: Provides helpful suggestions and templates to guide user input
- **Interactive Clarification**: Asks follow-up questions when intent is unclear or parameters are missing

### 4.3 APIs and Endpoints

The NLI exposes several APIs for internal component communication:

1. **Conversation API**: Manages conversation state, messages, and sessions
   - POST /api/conversations - Start new conversation
   - GET /api/conversations/{id} - Get conversation details
   - PUT /api/conversations/{id} - Update conversation
   - DELETE /api/conversations/{id} - Delete conversation

2. **Message API**: Handles individual messages within a conversation
   - POST /api/messages - Send a new message
   - GET /api/messages/{id} - Get message details

3. **User API**: Manages user profiles and preferences
   - GET /api/user/profile - Get current user profile
   - PUT /api/user/profile - Update user profile

4. **Help API**: Provides help content and suggestions
   - GET /api/help/context - Get context-sensitive help
   - GET /api/help/suggestions - Get command suggestions

### 4.4 Data Models

Conversations and messages are stored using structured data models. The example below shows the structure of a conversation object:

```json
{
  "conversation": {
    "id": "uuid-value",
    "user_id": "user-id",
    "title": "New API for user management",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "active",
    "messages": [
      {
        "id": "message-id-1",
        "type": "user",
        "content": "I need a new API server",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
        "metadata": {
          "source": "web",
          "language": "en"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "message-id-2",
        "type": "system",
        "content": "I can help you create a new API server. What would you like to name it?",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:01:50Z",
        "metadata": {
          "confidence": 0.95,
          "intent": "create_api_server"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
