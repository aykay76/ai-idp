# Implementation Kickoff: Where to Start

## Overview

After extensive design work, it's time to start building! This document outlines the practical starting point for implementing the AI-powered Internal Developer Platform.

## 1. Implementation Strategy

### 1.1 MVP Philosophy
- Start with **core functionality** that proves the concept
- Build **horizontally** (basic features across all components) before going **vertically** (advanced features)
- Prioritize **developer experience** from day one
- Make it **easy to contribute** for other developers

### 1.2 Foundation-First Approach
```
Foundation Layer (Week 1-2):
â”œâ”€â”€ Database Schema & Migrations
â”œâ”€â”€ Go Service Template 
â”œâ”€â”€ Docker Development Environment
â””â”€â”€ Basic Testing Framework

Core Services Layer (Week 3-4):
â”œâ”€â”€ API Gateway with Authentication
â”œâ”€â”€ Application Service (CRUD)
â”œâ”€â”€ Team Service (CRUD) 
â””â”€â”€ Basic UI Shell

Integration Layer (Week 5-6):
â”œâ”€â”€ Git Integration (GitHub Provider)
â”œâ”€â”€ Basic Resource Providers
â”œâ”€â”€ Control Plane Reconciliation
â””â”€â”€ End-to-End Testing

MVP Completion (Week 7-8):
â”œâ”€â”€ AI Integration Points
â”œâ”€â”€ UI Polish & UX
â”œâ”€â”€ Documentation
â””â”€â”€ Deployment Pipeline
```

## 2. Technical Foundation

### 2.1 Monorepo Structure

```

### 2.2 Technology Stack Decisions

**Backend Services:**
- **Language**: Go 1.21+ (excellent tooling, performance, maintainability)  
- **Framework**: Gin (lightweight, fast, good middleware ecosystem)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgx driver
- **Validation**: go-playground/validator + custom schema validation
- **Testing**: Testify + Dockertest for integration tests

**Infrastructure:**
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose for local dev
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (production)  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana (later)

**Frontend:**
- **Core**: Vanilla JavaScript + Web Components
- **Build**: Vite for development server and bundling
- **Testing**: Playwright for e2e testing
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with custom properties

docker-compose down     # Stop all services
```

### 4.3 Testing Strategy
```bash
Testing Pyramid:
â”œâ”€â”€ Unit Tests (70%)          # Fast, isolated, high coverage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Service logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Database operations  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Validation functions
â”œâ”€â”€ Integration Tests (20%)   # Service interactions, API contracts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Database integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Service-to-service
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ API endpoint tests
â””â”€â”€ E2E Tests (10%)          # Full user workflows
    â”œâ”€â”€ UI interactions
    â”œâ”€â”€ Cross-service workflows
    â””â”€â”€ Real browser testing
```

## 6. Next Steps

**Immediate Next Action**: Start with database schema and service template, as these are foundational for everything else.

**Week 1 Goals**:
1. Working PostgreSQL setup with migrations
2. Go service template that others can copy  
3. Docker Compose development environment
4. Basic testing framework and CI

**Week 2 Goals**:
1. API Gateway with authentication
2. Application Service fully working
3. Team Service fully working
4. Integration tests passing

This gives us a **solid foundation** to build the more advanced features on, while proving out the core architecture and developer workflow patterns.
