# Implementation Prerequisites and Considerations

## 1. Development Environment and Tooling

### 1.1 Local Development Setup
```yaml
development_environment:
  go_version: "1.21+"
  postgres_version: "15+"
  redis_version: "7+"
  node_version: "18+" # For frontend tooling
  
  required_tools:
    - Docker and Docker Compose
    - Go toolchain with air (live reload)
    - PostgreSQL client tools (psql, pg_dump)
    - Redis client tools
    - Git hooks for pre-commit checks
    - Vite for frontend development
    
  ide_recommendations:
    - VS Code with Go, PostgreSQL extensions
    - GoLand for Go development
    - Database GUI tools (TablePlus, pgAdmin)
```

### 1.2 Development Workflow Standards
```yaml
code_standards:
  go:
    formatting: gofmt + goimports
    linting: golangci-lint
    testing: Go test with testify
    documentation: godoc comments
    
  javascript:
    formatting: Prettier
    linting: ESLint with modern JS rules  
    testing: Vitest
    documentation: JSDoc for complex functions
    
  database:
    migrations: golang-migrate or custom Go migration tool
    naming: snake_case for tables/columns
    versioning: Sequential numbered migrations
```

## 2. Third-Party Integration Decisions

### 2.1 Cloud Provider APIs
```yaml

    compute: Virtual Machines, Container Instances, Azure Functions
    database: Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Cache for Redis
    storage: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Disks
    networking: Virtual Network, Load Balancer, Application Gateway

    - API rate limit handling
    
  authentication:
    github: GitHub Apps (not personal tokens)
    gitlab: Project access tokens with minimal scopes
```

### 2.3 CI/CD System Integration
```yaml
