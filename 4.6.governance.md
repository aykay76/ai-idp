# Governance & Policy Engine: Detailed Specification

## 1. Introduction

The Governance & Policy Engine serves as the control center for our AI-powered Internal Developer Platform, ensuring that all infrastructure creation and modification adheres to organizational policies, compliance requirements, and best practices. This component acts as a gatekeeper, validating and enforcing rules across the entire infrastructure lifecycle, from initial request through deployment and ongoing operations. By providing comprehensive policy enforcement, the system enables organizations to maintain security, compliance, and operational excellence while empowering developers with self-service capabilities.

Our governance approach leverages Open Policy Agent (OPA) and the Rego policy language as the foundation for policy definition and enforcement. This technology choice provides significant advantages for our AI-powered Internal Developer Platform:

### Unified Governance Framework
- **Consistency Across Domains**: Enables the same policy engine and language for both security policies (already used in cyber) and infrastructure governance
- **Shared Expertise**: Leverages existing team knowledge of OPA and Rego across the organization
- **Reusable Components**: Security policies can inform infrastructure governance and vice versa

### Cloud-Native and Provider Agnostic
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Works consistently across AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises environments
- **Future-Proof**: Protects against vendor lock-in and simplifies adoption of additional cloud providers
- **Native Integrations**: Out-of-the-box integrations with Kubernetes, Terraform, and other infrastructure tools

### Powerful and Expressive Policy Language
- **Declarative Approach**: Rego allows policies to be expressed as rules rather than procedural code, making them more readable and maintainable
- **Structured Decisions**: Generates rich decision documents that provide detailed feedback beyond simple allow/deny
- **Composable Policies**: Policies can be built from smaller, reusable modules for better organization

### Performance at Scale
- **Incremental Evaluation**: Optimizes performance by only evaluating rules that depend on changed inputs
- **Caching Mechanisms**: Decision results can be cached to improve response times
- **Bundle Distribution**: Efficient packaging and distribution of policies to multiple enforcement points

### Enhanced Developer Experience
- **Early Feedback**: Enables governance policies to be evaluated during initial natural language requests
- **Explainable Decisions**: Policies can generate human-readable explanations for governance decisions
- **Guided Refinement**: When potential violations are detected, provides clear guidance toward compliant alternatives

### Comprehensive Enforcement Capabilities
- **Multiple Enforcement Points**: Policies can be enforced at various stages from initial request through deployment
- **Flexible Actions**: Supports allow, deny, warn, modify, and require-approval actions
- **Auditability**: Built-in support for detailed audit trails of policy decisions

## 2. Component Overview

The Governance & Policy Engine is responsible for:

   - Industry standards (ISO 27001, NIST)
   - Data residency and sovereignty requirements
   - Audit trail and logging requirements
   - Data retention and deletion policies

3. **Cost Policies**

   - Maintenance and update policies

### 3.2 Policy Structure

Policies follow a standardized structure:

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "id": "pol-uuid-v4",
    "name": "database-cost-limit",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "category": "cost",
    "description": "Enforce cost limits for database resources",
    "severity": "high",
    "enabled": true,
    "implementation": {
      "engine": "opa",
      "language": "rego",
      "package": "idp.governance.cost"
    },
    "rego": "package idp.governance.cost\n\ndefault allow = false\n\nallow {\n  input.resource.type == \"database\"\n  input.estimated_cost <= 1000\n}\n\nviolation[msg] {\n  not allow\n  msg := sprintf(\"Database cost %v exceeds limit of 1000\", [input.estimated_cost])\n}"
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Policy Language: OPA and Rego

The system uses Open Policy Agent (OPA) with the Rego policy language for defining and evaluating governance policies:

- **OPA Integration**: Policies are evaluated using OPA's decision engine
- **Rego Syntax**: Policies are written in Rego, a declarative query language
- **Policy Packages**: Policies are organized into packages for modularity and reuse
- **Decision Documents**: OPA produces structured decision documents that guide system behavior

Example Rego policy for database cost limits:

```rego
package idp.governance.cost

default allow = false

# Allow database creation if cost is within limits
allow {
  input.resource.type == "database"
  input.estimated_cost <= 1000
}

# Generate violation messages
violation[msg] {
  not allow
  msg := sprintf("Database cost %v exceeds limit of 1000", [input.estimated_cost])
}

# Require approval for high-cost databases
approval_required {
  input.resource.type == "database"
  input.estimated_cost > 500
}
```

### 3.4 OPA Integration
The system integrates with OPA through:

- **Policy Bundles**: Policies are packaged and distributed as OPA bundles
- **Data Documents**: External data (quotas, resource catalogs) are provided to OPA as data documents
- **Decision API**: The system queries OPA via its decision API for policy evaluations
- **Caching**: OPA decisions are cached to improve performance
- **Versioning**: Policy versions are managed through OPA's bundle versioning
